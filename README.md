# State of Libre Graphics 2018


The opening presentation at Libre Graphics Meeting is “State of Libre Graphics,” an update from the many software, curation publication and umbrella projects of our Libre Graphics community.

For each project we want a title slide and one, none, or two content slides. The title slides should/could contain name of project, logo and perhaps a brief tag-line for/description of the project. The content slides should be about changes in the last year; as well as perhaps plans for the near future, it is good if the slides are a mostly visual; with speaker notes with context in the .txt file for what to to say with the slides.

**Naming of files:**

- projectname-0.png (or .jpg)
- projectname-1.png
- projectname-2.png
- projectname.txt

The graphics files should be 1024×768 – if they are not; they will be resized to fit.

The [demo-project](demo-project/) directory contains a set of empty files that you can build upon (and maybe better explain how to create the slides than those words)

If you're wondering what you should put on the slides, you can watch the [State of Libre Graphics 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URm3ke0LTD4).

For projects focused on video/animation; an up to 100second video/animation with audio would be welcome instead of slides 1 and 2. If this option is taken, upload the video somewhere and provide an URL for fetching it.

Content should be submitted by Tuesday the 24th of April.

Please send your slides to Ale Rimoldi: **ale AT graphicslab.org** or make a pull request to this repository.
