Next up:

- Bufifixing after v.2.10.0 release
- 2.10.xseries developed in parallel with 3.0
- 2.10.x open for new features

What 3.0 means:

- GTK+3 port
- API deprecation
- Better Wayland support
- Better support for graphic tablets on Windows (or so they say)

Challenges

- Active dev team is only 6 people
- Jehan and Ã˜yvind need a lot more community support via Patreon / Liberpay (they are getting there)
- 3.0 timeframe cannot be realistically estimated at this point
- We want shorter release cycles to keep both users and contributors interested (hence opening 2.10.x for new features)
