# G'MIC

-- SLIDE 0 --

G'MIC provides many different user interfaces to convert, manipulate, filter and visualize generic image datasets. It has more than 950 image processing functions. Due to its scripting capabilities, many more can be added.

## G'MIC-Qt plugin for Krita

The G'MIC-Qt plugin is now available for Krita 3.3+. Although it is not feature complete yet, we've received positive feedback.

## CeCILL-C, a more permissive license

The G'MIC core is now dual-licensed CeCILL-C (LGPL-compatible) or CeCILL (GPL-compatible). It's now possible to integrate `libgmic` and `gmic_stdlib` in closed-source software as long as modifications are given back to the community. This change does not affect the plugin or community filters.

## Improving the lineart colorization filter

The filter has two new features: "Autoclean" helps keep colors within the contour boundaries and hatching detection limits the number of small colored areas generated.

## Color equalizer in HSI, HSL and HSV spaces

This new filter allows the user to modify the hue and saturation for various brightness ranges in an image while maintaining brightness. E.g., a digital artist would be able to quickly colorize his or her grayscale artwork.

## Angular deformations

_Crease_ is a new local deformation filter that makes images "crispy"; e.g., make comic panels jagged or improve David Revoy's alien death ray.

## Detail enhancement without the "halos"

_Magic details_ and _Equalize local histograms_ are filters that consider the geometric content of the image (anisotropy) for local enhancement, allowing more detail and color to come through while reducing halos that typically arise from enhancement.

## Image deformations

Filters that apply geometric deformations are added regularly; e.g., we could add a local spherical or ellipsoidal deformation using _Spherize_.

## Artistic abstractions

An example of this is the new Super-pixels filter that partitions an image, based on similar colors, into geometric shapes that align to the contours. This is achieved by using the SLIC method (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering).

## G'MIC core and interpreter

- Syntax improvements making scripts easier to write, read and execute with a lower memory footprint.
- The math expression evaluator has received many optimizations and features making it more robust and capable.
- Support for .yuv video files now extends to more sampling modes (4:2:0, 4:2:2 or 4:4:4).

## A better G’MIC-Qt plugin

- The ability to set a timeout for previewing computationally intensive filters.
- Better management of filter parameters via menus, persistent values and a reset button.
- Preview area is cleaner and easier to zoom and maximize.
- Language support independent from the system defaults.

## G'MIC Online redesign

G’MIC Online is a web service allowing you to apply a subset of G’MIC filters on your images, directly inside a web browser.

The web service is now responsive, allowing us the user to apply a selection of G'MIC filters from mobile devices.
