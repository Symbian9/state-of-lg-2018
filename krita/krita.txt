Krita in 2017/2018

Releases: Krita 3.0 was released in 2016, We made 9 releases of Krita 3
in 2017. We released Krita 4 in 2018 with a new text tool, svg support,
python scripting, improved use of multi-core systems thanks to a project
sponsored by Intel.

2017 was a difficult year, but the community rallied magnificiently. We
now have two people working on krita full-time, and one working on Krita
part-time. The community and userbase are growing and very healthy.
Krita is the second-busiest project in the KDE community, directly after
the desktop shell project itself.

Plan for 2018

The main thing is stabilizing. We've been doing feature-oriented fund
raisers 3 times (2014, 2015, 2016), so lots of stuff got added. We've
decided to take a year to work on behind-the scenes things, like
resource management, improve the testing framework, get rid of a bunch
of long-standing bugs. We intend to have 6 releases of Krita 4 this year.
