Laidout continues to explore various types of interfaces.

For instance, Laidout now has a node based interface, implemented in part with gegl nodes.
One can also import and export filters from svg files.

Work continues connecting these nodes to Laidout objects,
such as use as object filters. Also to come are more ways
